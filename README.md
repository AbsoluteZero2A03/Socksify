Socksify
========

The finished product will be a tool that allows any command (curl,nmap,etc.) to make all requests via a SOCKS proxy.

As of right now, all I have is a single C file that connects to a hardcoded address via a hardcoded SOCKS proxy (which happens to be a Tor daemon running on localhost:9050).
